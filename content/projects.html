	<h2> Okay, time for you to know a little more about me. </h2>
	
	<p>
		I am a second year student at the University of Portsmouth on a Software Engineering course. Trust me‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs better 
		than it sounds!
	</p>
	<p>
		I am no expert with electronics, I have blown almost 15 LEDs within the past month, I have not blown any pi or 
		Arduino‚Ä¶ yet. My point towards all of this is to prove that I am not an expert, anyone can pick up a solder and 
		can call themselves an expert with electronics.
	</p>
	<p>
		Don‚Äôt feel like you have a brilliant and creative idea on a project, but you‚Äôre unable to make it happen because 
		you don‚Äôt have the experience. 
	</p> 
	<p>
		Think of it this way, the experts today had to start somewhere! They were just the same as all of us, they 
		had to follow YouTube videos and Google how to fix something. So don‚Äôt feel ashamed to Google and Youtube, 
		when ever I get stuck I always google and research the problem.

	<h2> What inspired me to start this project? </h2>

	<p>
		As usual, it all started when I watched Iron man for the first time, being stunned on what he can do! Yes, yes, 
		I know I can‚Äôt copy his exact work, with the suit and everything‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ nahhhhh, maybe later üòâ
		But anyways, that made me want to get into computer hardware. I found out, working with Software would benefit me
		more. All of the Raspberry Pi projects have some coding involved, which is practically my favorite part!
	</p>
		I first attempted making a replica version of JARVIS, The home assisting bot. But as some projects go, 
		their were to be a few failures along the way.
	</p>
	
	<h3> JARVIS MK1 (2009 ‚Äì 2011) ‚Äì </h3> 
	
	<p>
		As it starts with most people, I had a little inspiration from my favourite movie Iron Man. Hence the name JARVIS.
	</p>
	
	<li> Programming language: VB.NET </li>
	<li> Program: Visual Basic </li>

	<h3> RUBI MK2 (2011 ‚Äì 2014) ‚Äì </h3> 
	
	<p> 
		On the second version of my project, I started to look into JAVA programming. I then thought that it would be best 
		not to use the name JARVIS for my project.
	</p>
	
	<li> Programming language: JAVA </li>
	<li> Program: Eclipse </li>
	

	<h3>ALYX MK3 (2014 ‚Äì 2016) ‚Äì </h3> 
	<p>
		I created a system in which words could be introduced and learned, I could define functions on-the-fly. 
		Hearing my own voice talk back to me started to annoy me. Thinking Python would be the better option, 
		I thought that it was best to switch programming languages, this meant I had to restart the whole program.
	</p>
	
	<li> Programming language: Python </li>
	<li> Program: Python IDLE </li> 
	<li> Using a Laptop with a Linux system. </li> 
	

	<h3>HAS MK4 (2016 ‚Äì 2017) ‚Äì </h3> 
	<p>
		H.A.S is my latest up to date project. Deciding to use a Raspberry Pi 3 and an Arduino Board for security has 
		turned out to be the best option.
	</p>
	
	<li> Programming Language: Python and Arduino </li>
	<li> Program: Python IDLE and Arduino </li>
	<li> Using both Raspberry Pi and Arduino board. </li>
	
	<p>
		After that stage of making JARVIS, I realized that building an AI is HARD! So I decided to make Alyx a home 
		assistant bot, so much easier (Not giving up on the idea of building an AI, just putting that project on hold, 
		for now!).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		For a while, I knew that Alyx was missing something‚Ä¶. something that JARVIS could do, but my bot could not. 
		Control my living environment, turning on and off lights, opening and locking doors.
		This is where my second inspiration came into play.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		On one ordinary day, I woke up, got a shower, cycled into Uni, attended lectures, then once I sat down for my 
		programming practical, my former lecturer Simon came and sat down in between me and my friend as he overheard 
		our conversation about Raspberry Pi‚Äôs. We spoke for a bit about possible projects, then he took out his laptop 
		to show us, one of his main projects.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Now at the time, IT WAS SO COOL!
		He connected to his Pi, which was all the way in his office across campus, via SSH and then set up a webcam call, 
		accessing his webcam in the office. Me not being amazed, he then switched on a lamp!?! That caught my attention, 
		but that‚Äôs not the best part. He then started pushing buttons on his keypad, and a Robot arm came in to view!
	</p>
	
	<p>
		At this stage, I was completely amazed!
		He attempted to put a tea bag into his cup. ‚ÄúAttempted!‚Äù
		With me not knowing all of this was even possible, with just a few wires, a slab of code and a Raspberry Pi‚Ä¶ I 
		had to do it! I‚Äôve got the lamps up and running, and hoping to add more to it along the way!
